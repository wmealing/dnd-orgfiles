*** What is D&D 5E SRD REmastered?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: what-is-dd-5e-srd-remastered
:END:
This is an adaptation of the D&D 5E SRD REformatted in Markdown (.MD)
for easy export to other publishing formats. Please report any issues or
discrepancies within the material itself; see Discussions & Issues
below.

SRD page]] to compare the programs.

The material contained herein was REmastered line-by-line into Markdown
format to be utilized in your own 5E projects. I have painstakingly
converted the original Wizard's SRD v5.1 PDF to markdown, plus all
errata from the /Nov 2018 update/. For more information, please visit
the [[https://srd.wiki][SRD Wiki]].

Why Markdown format?

#+begin_html
  </summary>
#+end_html

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting
syntax created by [[https://daringfireball.net][John Gruber]]. By its
very nature, being a plain text file, it is designed to add
future-proofing to any set of documents while still maintaining basic
text and table formatting options. In addition, Markdown may be exported
to HTML and many other formats using a number of various Markdown
editors. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing
books, blogs, and messages, or to simply create rich text using plain
text in a Markdown editor.

Export Options

#+begin_html
  </summary>
#+end_html

I recommend using the following Markdown applications to edit the
material:

- [[https://typora.io][Typora]]: $15 (Pay Once)
- [[https://code.visualstudio.com/Download][Visual Studio Code]]: FREE!

To export Markdown to various publishing formats, I recommend using
Typora (listed above) as it has many good export options which will
satify the majority of users. Most any good Markdown editors will offer
basic exports. However, if you want more options,
[[https://panwriter.com][PanWriter]] is the best solution. However, for
PanWiter to function properly, the following applications must also be
installed to maximize your export options:

- [[https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/2.19.2/pandoc-2.19.2-macOS.pkg][Download
  PanDoc]]

Alternatively, you can install pandoc using Homebrew:

=brew install pandoc=

Homebrew can also install other software that integrates with Pandoc.
For example, to install librsvg (its rsvg-convert covers formats without
SVG support), Python (to use Pandoc filters), and BasicTeX (to typeset
PDFs with LaTeX):

=brew install librsvg python homebrew/cask/basictex=

Note: On unsupported versions of macOS (more than three releases old),
Homebrew installs from the source, which takes additional time and disk
space for the ghc compiler and dependent Haskell libraries.

There is a zip file containing the binaries and man pages, for those who
prefer not to use the installer. Simply unzip the file and move the
binaries and man pages to whatever directory you like.

By default, Pandoc creates PDFs using LaTeX. Because a full MacTeX
installation uses four gigabytes of disk space, we recommend BasicTeX or
TinyTeX and using the tlmgr tool to install additional packages as
needed. If you receive errors warning of fonts not found:

=tlmgr install collection-fontsrecommended=

Obsidian Friendly

This adaption of the D&D 5E SRD contains optional content designed
specifically for PKM applications like Obsidian.
[[https://obsidian.md][Obsidian.md]] is a powerful knowledge base on top
of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. That definition sounds
simple; however, Obsidian is much, much more. Visit
[[https://www.youtube.com/c/JoshPlunkett/videos][Josh Plunket's YouTube
Channel]] to learn more about using Obsidian for your roleplaying game
campaign management.
